# Northen-Cooling-Storage-Load-Calculator
Hi, Guy's!  This is one of my client's projects for Northen Cooling Storage. 
The Project is to develop a desktop application for the Company to monitor and perform daily tasks. 
I have developed a desktop application in python using the Tkinter library. 
This project is having features like calculating transmission load, product load, internal load, etc. 
I have shared the UI code here due to company police I can't share the actual calculation of loading formulas.
